# pacmen.github.io

Description: 
In this project, every time the pacman button is pressed, a new pacman image is added to a random location on the screen. Clicking the 'start game' button will trigger movement for the pacmen, each with a rondomly choosen velocity. The packmen move around the screen and change direction when they reach the screen-edge. The code was provided by MITxPro and completed by me as an assignment for the Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort course.

How to Run: 
To use this program, open the index.html file in your web browser. Click "add pacman" to add a pacman to the screen. More than one pacman can be added. The "start game" button initiates the pacmen movements.

Future Improvement: 
Modifying the source code to enable players to direct the movement of the PacMan characters.
